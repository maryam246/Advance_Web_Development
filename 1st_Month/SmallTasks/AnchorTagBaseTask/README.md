# Anchor Tag Example

This project demonstrates the use of anchor (`<a>`) tags within an HTML table to navigate between different pages.

## Project Structure

The HTML file contains a table with three anchor links:
- **Table**: Links to `supportingFiles/table.html`
- **Images**: Links to `supportingFiles/image.html` (opens in the same window)
- **Headings**: Links to `supportingFiles/heading.html`

## How to Use
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Click on the links inside the table to navigate to the respective pages.

## Features
- Demonstrates hyperlink navigation within an HTML table.
- Uses `target="_self"` for the "Images" link to open in the same window.
- Organizes links neatly inside a bordered table.

## Requirements
- A browser to open the HTML file.
- Supporting HTML files inside the `supportingFiles` directory.
