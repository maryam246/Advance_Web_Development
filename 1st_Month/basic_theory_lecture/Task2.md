## **10. Why is HTML called HyperText Markup and CSS called Cascading Style Sheet?**  
### **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**  
- **HyperText** means linking between web pages.
- **Markup Language** means it structures content using tags.

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
```

### **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**  
- **Cascading** means styles apply in a **hierarchy** (Inline > Internal > External CSS).
- **Style Sheets** define how elements appear on the webpage.

ðŸ”¹ **Example of Cascading Effect:**  
```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
}
.title {
    color: green;
}
h1[style] {
    color: red;
} /* Inline CSS wins */
```
ðŸ“Œ **Result:** The heading will be red because inline CSS has the highest priority.

âœ… Format text (bold, italic, underlined).
