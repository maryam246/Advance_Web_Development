# Basics Information about WEB-Technologies
## 1. Previous Versions of HTML vs. New Versions

### Evolution of HTML

* **HTML 1.0 - HTML 4.01:**
    * Focused on basic structure and presentation.
    * Limited semantic meaning.
* **XHTML:**
    * A stricter, XML-based version of HTML.
    * Aimed for cleaner, more consistent code.
* **HTML5:**
    * Introduced semantic elements (`<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`).
    * Enhanced multimedia support (`<video>`, `<audio>`).
    * Canvas for graphics and local storage.
    * HTML5 supports offline applications (like Google Docs).
* **HTML Living Standard:**
    * Continuously updated, replacing the versioned approach.
    * Focus on ongoing improvements and features.

### Key Differences

* Older versions: Less flexible, relied heavily on CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.
* HTML5/Living Standard: Richer semantics, multimedia support, improved accessibility.

## 2. How to Structure a Model in HTML?

### **What is HTML Structure?**
Think of an HTML page as a **house**:
- **Foundation** → `<html>`
- **Rooms** → `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- **Doors & Windows** → `<nav>`, `<a>`, `<button>`

### **Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Website Structure</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>Website Header</header>
    <nav>Navigation Menu</nav>
    <section>Main Content</section>
    <footer>Footer</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## 3. What is CSS, and How Do CSS Frameworks Help?

### **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
CSS is like **clothing** for HTML – it controls how a webpage looks.
### CSS Frameworks
* **Benefits:** Faster development, consistent design, responsive layouts.
* **Examples:**
    * **Bootstrap:** Responsive grid systems and pre-built components.
    * **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first framework for rapid styling.
    * **Materialize CSS:** Based on Google's Material Design.
    * **Foundation:** Robust framework with responsive features.
- **Without Framework**: You style everything manually.


## 4. How is JavaScript Used for Functionality? What Libraries Like jQuery Are Used in Mobile Apps?

### **Why Use JavaScript?**
JS adds **interactivity** – clicking buttons, animations, form validation, etc.

### **jQuery – Simplifying JavaScript**
Instead of writing long JavaScript code, jQuery allows short and simple functions.
### General Javascript Frameworks.

* **React.js:** for building user interfaces.
* **Vue.js:** for building user interfaces.
* **Angular:** a comprehensive framework for building complex applications.
* **Ionic:** Uses web technologies for cross-platform apps.
  
## 5. Where JavaScript is Used

### Frontend (Client-Side)

* Interactive UIs, form validation, animations, dynamic content.

### Backend (Server-Side)

* **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime.
* Web servers, APIs, real-time applications.

## 6. Is PHP a Backend Language? Was Facebook Developed in PHP? What is Laravel?

- **PHP** is a backend scripting language.
- **Facebook** initially used PHP but later switched to **Hack (an evolved version of PHP)**.

### Laravel
**Laravel** is a PHP framework that speeds up development.
* PHP framework for structured web development.
* Routing, database management, authentication.

## 7. Difference Between Frontend and Backend Development

### **Example: A Restaurant**
- **Frontend (Waiter & Menu)** → What users see and interact with.
- **Backend (Kitchen & Chef)** → Where actual processing happens (database, server).

### **Technologies Used:**
| Category  | Technologies |
|-----------|-------------|
| Frontend  | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular |
| Backend   | PHP, Node.js, Python, Java |

## 8. Local Databases vs. Online Databases

### Local Databases

* Data stored on the user's computer or local server.
* **Local Database** → Like a personal diary on your desk (Example: SQLite).
* Faster local access.

### Online Databases

* Data stored on remote servers.
* **Online Database** → Like Google Drive, accessible from anywhere (Example: Firebase MongoDB Atlas).
* Accessible over the internet.
* Multiple user access.

## 9. SQL in PHP for Application Data Storage

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

* Interacts with relational databases.
* PHP connects to databases and executes SQL queries.
* Data storage, retrieval, and management.

## 10. AJAX in jQuery

### AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

* Updates web page content without reloading.
* jQuery AJAX simplifies AJAX requests.
* Dynamic content updates and improved user experience.

  ## 11. Differences Between Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0

### **Example: Evolution of Online Shopping**
- **Web 1.0 (Static Websites - 1990s)**: Like a printed catalog – you can read, but not interact.
- **Web 2.0 (Interactive - 2000s-Present)**: Like Amazon – users can comment, interact, and shop online.
- **Web 3.0 (Decentralized - Future)**: Like a blockchain-based store – no central authority, AI-driven.

### **Feature Comparison:**
| Feature            | Web 1.0                      | Web 2.0                          | Web 3.0                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Interaction**    | Static (Read-only)           | Interactive (Social Media)       | AI & Decentralized (Blockchain)  |
| **Examples**       | Early websites               | Facebook, YouTube                | Cryptocurrencies, AI chatbots    |
| **Data Ownership** | Controlled by website owners | Shared between users & platforms | Users have full control over data|
| **Technology**     | HTML, CSS                    | JavaScript, AJAX, APIs           | Blockchain, AI, Smart Contracts  |
